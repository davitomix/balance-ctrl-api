<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Balance Control API][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/davitomix/balance-ctrl-api/)

This is an API to keep track of the incomings and expenses that a user makes, it can be by day, week, month or by category.
The main goal of this API is to let the front end developers set up a backend in a quick and easy way to start an building the app and getting data.

The main features of the API are:

- Admin user.
- Authentication via JTW Token for modification operations (create, update, destroy).
- Any user can access to the get data from the endpoints either balances or operations.
- Only a logged in user can perform operations to their own operations (create, update, destroy).
- Only an admin user cna perform operations to the balances, that are shared between all the users (create, update, destroy).

There are 3 models on this API:

- Users. It can be an admin or a normal user.
- Balances. This filed its like the categories, it can be, day, week, month or whatever you want.
- Operations. Each incoming or expense registered by a user.

Access permissions:

- Any user can access to the data, either balances or operations of any user.
- Only logged in users can perform operations over their own operations.
- Only admin users can perform operations over balances.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- Rails 5.2.4
- Ruby 2.6.4
- Postman
- Newman 5.2.0

### Setup

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```ruby
$ bundle
```

Next, migrate the database:

```ruby
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, make some moc data to interaction:

```ruby
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```ruby
$ bundle exec rspec
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

Install the HTTP client of your preference, I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com)

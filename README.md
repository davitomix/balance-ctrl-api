<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Balance Control API][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/davitomix/balance-ctrl-api/)

This is an API to keep track of the incomings and expenses that a user makes.
The main goal of this API is to allow front-end developers to set up a backend in a quick and easy way to start consuming data and focus on the application client side logic not in the back.
Also, it is a good option to have a server running locally for the development stage, in this way you are sure that the access points are reliable and fast.

The main features of this API are:

- Admin user.
- Authentication via JWT Tokens restricting access to mutable data operations (create, update, destroy).
- Any user can get access to data from the endpoints either balances or operations.
- Only a logged in user can perform operations to their own operations (create, update, destroy).
- Only an admin user cna perform operations to the balances, that are shared between all the users (create, update, destroy).

There are 3 type of object models on this API:

- Users. It can be an admin or a normal user.
- Balances. This field perfomrms like a categories switcher, in this case balances.
- Operations. Each incoming or expense registered by a user.

Access permissions:

- Any user can access to the data, either balances or operations of any user.
- Only logged in users can perform operations over their own operations.
- Only admin users can perform operations over balances.

### Documentation

The documentation was built using raddocs.
<br />

[Documentation :rocket:](https://bs-balance-ctrl-mx.herokuapp.com/api_docs)

### Built With

- Postman, Newman.
- Rails.
- JWT auth.
- Serialization.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- Rails 5.2.4
- Rspec 3.9
- Ruby 2.6.4
- Newman 5.2.0
- npm 6.14.7

### Setup

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```ruby
$ bundle
```

Next, migrate the database:

```ruby
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, make some moc data to interaction:

```ruby
$ rails db:seed
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```ruby
$ bundle exec rspec
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```ruby
$ rails s
```

Install the HTTP client of your preference, I used [Postman](https://www.postman.com)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### Newman - Postsman

In this examples im going to use postman to get more detailed information.
You can get the postman collection and environment from

```
./app/assets/docs/newman
```

#### Setting up newman CLI.

```sh
npm install -g newman
```

#### Running newman collections.

There are 4 cases collections, all of them try to perform the following operations over the balances and operations endpoints:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE

The 4 cases are:

- Login as an admin user.
- Login as user.
- Signup new user.
- No logged in user.

After start the rails server, run:

LOGIN ADMIN COLLECTION

```sh
newman run ./app/assets/docs/newman/api-test-local-admin-login.postman_collection.json -e ./app/assets/docs/newman/bal-ctrl-api.postman_environment.json -n 2
```

<p align="center">

LOGIN USER COLLECTION

```sh
newman run ./app/assets/docs/newman/api-test-local-user-login.postman_collection.json -e ./app/assets/docs/newman/bal-ctrl-api.postman_environment.json -n 2
```

</p>

SIGN UP COLLECTION

```sh
newman run ./app/assets/docs/newman/api-test-local-user-signup.postman_collection.json -e ./app/assets/docs/newman/bal-ctrl-api.postman_environment.json -n 2
```

<p align="center">

NOT AUTH USER COLLECTION

```sh
newman run ./app/assets/docs/newman/api-test-local-no-login.postman_collection.json -e ./app/assets/docs/newman/bal-ctrl-api.postman_environment.json -n 2
```

<p align="center">
